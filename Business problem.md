You probably have an acquaintance, friend (or even yourself) who is afraid of air travel. The speed, the height, the feeling when taking off and landing... Well, you should know that the probabilities of suffering a plane accident are very low if we compare them, for example, with the possibilities of suffering a car accident. 

We use the car for everything, even more than we should, exposing our lives and those of others every time we do. Therefore, it would be useful to know, based on the state of the road or the weather, the probabilities of having an accident, in order to drive more slowly or modify your route.

This is what we are going to work on in this project.

In this sense, the business problem is to predict the severity (from 0 to fatality) of car accident, helping the drivers to take better options based on the risk associated with their travels.
